/*
 * When you send someone a message through cjdns, it's encrypted.
 * When you send the first message to a router, it has a nice header on it which tells them your key
 * and allows them to establish a cryptographic session with you. For every message after that, they
 * need to remember that session and use it to decrypt the message.
 *
 * The way they remember which session a message is associated with is to look at the switching
 * label from that message and compare that with the label which was used when the first message was
 * sent (with the header).
 *
 * What I didn't think about at the time is that labels change. Nodes find a better path to a
 * destination and expect the same session to work. It would work if the other end knew which
 * session to use but it can't know, the label is different.
 *
 * This is a protocol bug.
 *
 * In my opinion, the best way to fix it is to send an additional header before the crypto nonce
 * which tells the foreign node who it came from. When the handshake message is sent, the node will
 * send a 4 byte integer which the other end will store. Every time the other end sends a
 * non-handshake message to this end, it will prepend that same integer to the encrypted message and
 * on recieving a message, a node will use that number to do a lookup of the correct session to use.
 * The number can be a pointer or index offset so this can be quite fast.
 * Integer 0xFFFFFFFF shall be reserved and handshake messages which contain this value must be
 * ignored or treated as protocol 0 messages.
 *
 * But this is a protocol break.
 *
 * If a node gets handed a number and doesn't know what to do with it, it will think it's a
 * CryptoAuth header and it will fail. New nodes would be able to try a message as the old form if
 * the new form doesn't work but old nodes will just fail if they are ever sent a message in the new
 * form.
 *
 * Proposed Solution:
 * A key will be sent in all findNodes responses in the router, this key will be "np" for nodes'
 * protocol (version).
 * It will contain a string representation of a list of the protocol version numbers for the nodes
 * which it is introducing. The numbers will all be the same number of bytes and the first byte will
 * give that number. The length of the string will always be equal to one, plus the number of nodes
 * times the value of the first byte.
 *
 * This example shows the p which would accompany a findNodes response containing 1 node with
 * protocol version zero and one node with protocol version 1.
 *
 * "np": "\x01\x00\x01"
 *
 * 2:np3:\x01\x00\x01
 *
 * This example shows the p which would accompany a findNodes response containing 1 node with
 * protocol version 300 and two nodes with protocol version 5.
 *
 * "np": "\x02\x01\x2c\x00\x05\x00\x05"
 *
 * 2:np7:\x02\x01\x2c\x00\x05\x00\x05
 *
 * All multi-byte numbers shall be encoded in big endian encoding.
 *
 * Each node will have an internal compatibility matrix giving protocol version numbers which
 * can communicate, a node shall not respond to a findNodes message with a response containing any
 * nodes which are known to be incompatible with the protocol version of the requesting node.
 * Versions which are beyond the highest version number in the compatability matrix will be assumed
 * to have the same compatability as the highest number in the table.
 *
 * All messages shall contain shall contain an "p" key as well but these will have a benc integer
 * representing the protocol version of the sending node.
 *
 * Change to the Ping switch control message:
 * New switch ping messages will all be 8 or more bytes long, they will begin with a magic field
 * and then a version number which is the version of the sending node.
 * The magic will be set to 0x09f91102 for all ping messages and to 0x9d74e35b in the response
 * messages (these numbers shall be big endian encoded). Following this number will be a 4 byte
 * field containing the protocol version. Nodes which only speak protocol version 0 will be
 * identifyable because they echo back 0x09f91102 rather than replacing it and they will be unlikely
 * to send a ping request whose content begins with 0x09f91102.
 *
 * Protocol1.1
 * In protocol0 there was a single pool of sessions shared between the outer and inner layer.
 * In protocol1 it was split because one pool needed to have handles and the other pool didn't.
 * The problem with this is communications do not necessarily travel back and forth along the
 * same path and protocol1 exhibited a pathology wherein one node was direct sending packets to
 * another while the other was routing the responses via an intermediary.
 * There were 2 CryptoAuth sessions between the two nodes and neither session was entering run
 * state. So protocol1 was broken and the new protocol1 (protocol1.1) sends session handles on top
 * of the CryptoAuth handshake headers even if the handshake is in the inner layer (under the Ipv6
 * header). It does not however send handles in the inner layer when the inner layer CryptoAuth
 * session is in HANDSHAKE3 state or above.
 * Protocol1.1 still identifies itself as Protocol1, it will not be able to communicate with
 * protocol0 in some circumstances. If it knows nothing about the other node and it forwards a
 * message via an intermediary, the message will be unreadable at the other end.
 *
 * Protocol1.2
 * Changes in protocol1.1 are reverted as a solution was found in the implementation.
