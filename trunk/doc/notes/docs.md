what needs docs?

especially useful stuff

- contrib/python/peerStats - shows a list of your peers and their connection status as well as byte counts
- contrib/python/cjdnsadminmaker.py - generates .cjdnsadmin for use with other scripts

"best practices for web development on hyperboria"

- not including google APIs
- ssl (certificate authority data leak)  CAs are bad. NSA probably has most of the CA keys.
- assuming everyone is going to try to hack you.. because they would on clearnet anyway
- listing a server's ipv6 in a conspicuous location (opt out of ICANN)
- listing of available services on any given node (even a simple webserver saying who you are is kinda nice, there exists no way to tell who's who by IP)

Good Ideas(tm)

- Turn off password auth if you are running sshd on hype. Especially if you have crap passwords. http://couch.syrinxist.org/security ah
