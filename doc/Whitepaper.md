# What?

Imagine an Internet where every packet is cryptographically
protected from source to destination against espionage and forgery, getting
an IP address is as simple as generating a cryptographic key, core routers
move data without a single memory look up, and denial of service is a term
read about in history books. Finally, becoming an ISP is no longer confined
to the mighty telecoms, anyone can do it by running some wires or turning on
a wireless device.

This is the vision of cjdns. 

# Why?

The Internet is built on protocols which largely date back to the late 80's
or earlier. At a time when it was a network of anarchistic academics and
scholars showing the ITU that open standards matter, it was absolutely enough.
Over time the network has gotten bigger and the users have found new needs.

In the age when packet inspection is universal and security breaches are
commonplace, cryptographic integrity and confidentiality are becoming more of
a requirement. The US government recognized this requirement and has been
helping through [IPSEC] and [DNSSEC] efforts.

Another issue is how are we going to route packets in a world where the global
routing table is simply too large for any one router to hold it all? Despite
the heroic efforts of core network engineers, the growth of the global routing
table seems an unstoppable march. Cisco router company has proposed a plan
called Locater/Identifier Separation Protocol, or [LISP] which aims to solve
this by re-aggregating the routing table without forcing people to change their
precious IP addresses. A different view of this problem is IP address
allocation, currently it is done by a central organization which assigns IP
addresses in such a way as to make the routing table as small as possible.
Unfortunately this creates a bar of entry to the ISP sphere because aspiring
network operators must register with the central organization and apply for an
allocation of IP addresses while demonstrating that they will not be wasted.
It is always easier to show that you need IP addresses if you already have a
network.

Denial of service, an attempt to prevent legitimate users from accessing a
service[1], is likewise a new problem in the expanding network. To my knowledge,
there is no general purpose solution to denial of service attacks. Solutions to
packet flood based denial of service often revolve around hosting a service on
many computers so that they can handle an enormous amount of traffic.

Finally, the existing protocols are difficult to use, we cannot reasonably
assign blame to anyone for this, many of these protocols are over thirty years
old and demonstrate a level of craftsmanship which I can only hope to one day
achieve. However, thirty years takes its toll on the best of us and as the
Internet grew and became more complex, the administration interface of the
typical router has grown a thicket of knobs, buttons and switches to match the
proliferation of use cases and failure modes. As a result, network operation
has become a science where students receive degrees and certificates for knowing
the meanings of the plethora of knobs and switches, it has also become, like the
tuning of the race car, an art, passed from master to apprentice and shared on
mailing lists. Suffice to say, the bar of entry into the ISP realm is too high.
Users, particularly in the ad-hoc wireless network arena have observed the high
bar of entry into traditional routing and have developed a menu of alternative,
self-configuring protocols such as [OSLR], [HSLS], and [BATMAN].


## So the problems are already solved?

Not every problem listed has an existing solution and of the ones which do,
many of the solutions are based on incompatible technology. For example: OSLR
was not designed to operate with IPSEC and LISP. Even where the solutions exist
and are ready for deployment, they still require mass technology adoption and
they don't offer existing ISPs significant immediate gains.

The mismatch is rather absurd. On the one hand there are scholars, engineers,
hardware and software designers with combined over 1000 years of experience.
There are mathematical formulae, proofs, papers and specification documents;
written, circulated, peer reviewed and written again. On the other hand you
have a single volunteer developer, a clean slate, and an attitude that
nothing is impossible. How can this be anything short of lunacy?

*In revolutionary times, the old book only weighs you down.*

cjdns is built on the idea that the ISPs and hosting providers which exist
now will never upgrade, not to LISP, not to DNSSEC, not even to IPv6 in any
meaningful way. Building new systems to be compatible with old systems is
catering to the audience you will never have. Asking existing ISPs to upgrade
for the common good is asking them to take a risk with no immediate benefit.
cjdns is about throwing out the book and redefining the specifications in a
way that will be fast, secure, and most importantly, *easy* for the next
generation of ISPs to deploy and use.


## What is this denial of service?

Usage of a service can be interrupted by sending a flood of unwanted packets
to a host from a large number of infected "zombie" machines. This, known as
[DDoS], is a problem which worsens every year as the upload speed of all
infected nodes on the Internet grows in proportion to the download speed of any
given link. Being infected with a virus and participating in DDoS, though not a
picnic, is not an emergency for the owner of the infected machine. Nor is it an
emergency for their ISP. DDoS is always "their problem"... Until it strikes in
your network. Sadly, a common response from a datacenter is to stop carrying the
controversial content, making DDoS an effective censorship tool and encouraging
the practice.

Another form of denial of service which is even more insidious is intimidation
by threat of faux court action. This form of denial of service is especially
effective since most people get their IP addresses from their ISP, when their
ISP is threatened, they need to make a judgment call as to the validity of the
claim and they often act as judge and jury, disconnecting a customer in order to
avoid conflict. Those who have their own IP addresses assigned to them, are able
to essentially be their own ISP and to peer with a multitude of other ISPs
making it very difficult to threaten anyone but them.


## What is the routing table and why does it keep getting bigger?

A more technical issue with the Internet, and one of which many people are
unaware, is address space deaggregation. Every computer connected to the
Internet needs an address, a number which uniquely identifies it and which is
attached to every piece of data which is to be sent to that computer. At every
stop along its path through the Internet, a packet (unit of data) has its
address field examined by a router so it can decide which wire that packet
should be sent down. Routers have an easier time if addresses are in big blocks
so that a router can look quickly at the first numbers in the address and know,
for example, that it is destined for somewhere in China, not exact but enough to
know which wire to send it though. People naturally want as many addresses as
they can possibly get and they want them in the smallest blocks possible, this
is so they can then control (or buy and sell) these small blocks independently.
The smaller the blocks of addresses which are announced, the larger the routing
tables become and the more work the Internet's core routers must do in order to
send a packet in the right direction. There have been attempts to aggregate
addresses back in to groups but nonetheless, the number of small announcements
in the global routing table has grown every year.

To address the growing routing tables, Cisco has proposed a new protocol called
Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol or LISP. The idea of LISP is to
separate the addresses which people use from the addresses which routers use,
like a lower level version of DNS. LISP allows the edge ISPs and users to see
the Internet as they want it, deaggregated into small pieces for political
reasons, and the routers to see the Internet as they want it, centralized
hierarchical pyramid of addresses emanating from some arbitrary center point.
This design works well in existing routers since they are designed to get
packets with a universally unique address and look that address up in a table.
This is advertised as a design feature but LISP is limited in its vision, if
one must look up the "real location" of a server before forwarding a packet,
why not simply look up the fastest path?


## I don't care, it's their problem.

Each of these problems is a tragedy of the commons problem. The users of virus
infected computers are incentivized to save money rather than purchasing a
product or service to rid their computer of the infection. While there are
solutions such as egress filtering which decrease the problem, ISPs are
incentivized to implement as little security as possible because they are not
directly affected. Denial of service whether by packet flooding or by faux legal
action benefits the attacker who is able to hide the truth or victimize service
providers as well as organizations who make it their business to provide DoS
related services. The victim who all too often publishes information for no
other reason than satisfaction of telling the truth, is the only party harmed
by this type of attack, and he is the least able to prevent it. Address space
deaggregation benefits the edge ISPs who gain more flexibility in how their
network is organized at the cost of the core ISPs whose only defense is the
"we will not route that" nuclear option which would no doubt bring about a
revolt from the edge ISPs.

Each of these problems hurts everyone, DDoS forces ISPs to over prevision their
lines, denial of service through faux legal action increases the cost of running
a community website or ISP since each accusation must be reviewed and its
validity assessed, and address deaggregation means everyone must pay more to
have their packets routed through increasingly high power routers, and
difficulty of operating a router and getting a block of IP addresses hurts
competition in the ISP sphere, thus increasing prices and impeding progress.


# How?

cjdns is made of three major components which are woven together.
There is a switch, a router, and a CryptoAuth module. With total disregard for
the OSI layers, each module is inherently dependent on both of the others. The
router cannot function without routing in a small world which is made possible
by the switch, the switch is blind and dumb without the router to command it,
and without the router and switch, the CryptoAuth has nothing to protect.


## The Switch

*He doesn't think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being.*

Switches use an internal numeric compression scheme to compress the interface
index into a few bits of the 64-bit label. How they compress the number is an
implementation detail as long as they can read a label number and know how many
of the low bits "belong to them" as opposed to the next switch along the path.
Also the routing interface of each node is always compressed as the 4 bits "0001".

After determining the correct destination interface, the switch will bit shift
the label to the right and add reversed bits to the now empty left side of the
label such that if the entire label were reversed, the switch would send the
packet in the opposite direction. In the event of an error, the switch does a
bitwise reversal of the entire label and sends the packet back where it came
from. By doing a full bitwise reversal, the switches need not care how other
switches encode the numbers or be able to reverse the order since they can
reverse the the entire label.

There are always at least 3 zero bits between the reversed return path and
the forward path, but the zeroes from the reversed source routing interface
and the target routing interface can overlap.

                        1               2               3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     0 |                                                               |
       -                         Switch Label                          -
     4 |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     8 |      Type     |                  Priority                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Switch headers are designed to be small and efficient. The fields include the
`label` of which some number of bits (henceforth known as a discriminator)
belong to each switch along the forwarding path, the `Type` field indicating
the type of packet. Reserved packet types are `0` for opaque data, and `1` for
switch control messages (eg errors). The `Priority` field contains a number
which represents how important the delivery of a packet is. When a link becomes
saturated, the switch sending packets over that link SHOULD drop packets of
least priority and MAY decrease the priority of all packets passing through it.
When packets are dropped, switches SHOULD emit an error packet with the inverse
label to be sent to the sender. Switches SHOULD make adjustments based on error
packets which are sent in response to packets which they forwarded, forwarding
error packets is OPTIONAL, in flood situations it may not be wise.

If Alice wants to send a packet to Fred via Bob, Charlie, Dave and Elinor, she
will send a message over her interface to Bob's. This packet will have a label
that causes the packet to be routed to Charlie then on to Dave.

NOTE: Spaces between bits are for illustration only, switches do not know how
many bits of a label are used by anyone other than themselves.

Alice's original label, before entering her switch:

    0000000000000000000000000 0001 101011 011010 100101101 10111 0100011
    ^^^-- unused space --^^^^                                    ^^^^^^^-- Alice's discriminator for switching to Bob.

The source discriminator for a routing interface is always "0001" (and gets
prefixed with zeroes to match the length of "0100011"), so she sends this label
to Bob:

    1000000 0000000000000000000000000 0001 101011 011010 100101101 10111
    ^^^^-- Alice's discriminator for herself (reversed)            ^^^^^-- Bob's discriminator for routing to Charlie.

Bob shifts off his discriminator and applies to the top of the label the bit-
reversed discriminator for the Bob->Alice interface.

    11001 1000000 0000000000000000000000000 0001 101011 011010 100101101
    ^^^^^ ^^^^-- Alice's discriminator for herself (reversed)  ^^^^^^^^^-- Charlie's discriminator for Dave.
        ^-- Bob's discriminator for Alice, bit-reversed.


Charlie removes his discriminator and applies the reversed discriminator for
sending to Bob then forwards to Dave.

    110110011 11001 1000000 0000000000000000000000000 0001 101011 011010
    ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^                                          ^^^^^^-- Dave's discriminator for Elinor.
    ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^    ^-- Alice's discriminator for herself (reversed)
    ^^^^^^^^^     ^-- Bob's discriminator for Alice (reversed).
            ^-- Charlie discriminator for Bob (reversed).

Supposing Dave cannot forward the packet and needs to send an error, he does
not know where Charlie's discriminator ends and Bob's begins so he can't
re-order them but because they are bit reversed, he can reverse the order by
bit reversing the entire label.

    010110 110101 1000 0000000000000000000000000 0000001 10011 110011011
                                                    ^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^-- Charlie's discriminator for Bob.
                                                    ^^^^ ^-- Bob's discriminator for Alice.
                                                       ^ Alice's discriminator for herself.

Dave can then send the packet back to Charlie who need not know what it is in
order to forward it correctly on to Bob and then to Alice. If the packet had
reached Fred, he would be able to use the same technique of reversing the label
in order to determine its origin.

In order for labels to be able to be spliced together, the most significant bit
in a label must always be `1` so that we know where it ends. Since all routes
must end at a router, this means that all switches must regard `1` as a
reference to the router which sits atop them. Specifically, any label whose
least significant 4 bits are `0001` MUST be regarded as a self reference and
routers must never send a message with a label for which the highest 3 bits are
not zero. This is important so that the reverse route data applied by routers
along the path is not mistaken for additional forward route.

Supposing a node uses 8 bits to represent 256 switch slots, the 16 of those slots
ending in `0001` must point to it's own router in order for other nodes to be able
to splice routes through it.

Splicing is done by XORing the second part with `1` and shifting it left by the
log base 2 of the first part, then XORing the result with the first part. 

Given:

    routeAB =        0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001011101110101011001

    XOR 1            0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
    equals           0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000110101010101

    << log2(routeAB) 0000000000000000000000000000000000110101010101000000000000000000
    XOR  routeAB     0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001011101110101011001
    equals routeAC   0000000000000000000000000000000000110101010100011101110101011001
                                                                  ^-- Overlap bit

The log base 2 represents the index of the first set bit, starting from the
right. This means that shifting by the log base 2 leaves 1 bit of overlap, this
along with the XORing of the second part (`routeBC`) against `1` causes the
highest bit in the first part to be overwritten.

Given two routes, it is possible to determine whether one route is an extension
of another one, this is similar to the reverse of the the splicing routine. To
determine that routeAC "routes through" the node at the end of by routeAB, one
simply takes the bitwise complement of zero, shifted right by 64 minus the log
base 2 of routeAB, bitwise ANDs it against routeAB and routeAC and compares the
results, if they are equal then routeAC begins with routeAB.

    routeAC =        0000000000000000000000000000000000110101010100011101110101011001
    routeAB =        0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001011101110101011001

    g = 64 - min(log2(routeBC), log2(routeAC))

    ~0 =             1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

    h = ~0 >> g

    h & routeAB      0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011101110101011001

In order to allow a switch to add more interfaces without knowing how many it
will use in advance, switches should be able to add new interfaces whose
discriminators use more bits than the ones for the old interfaces. However, when
a switch forwards a packet, the source discriminator MUST NOT be longer than the
destination discriminator, otherwise there would not be be enough room for it in
the space made by shifting the label. To resolve this, a switch's number
compression scheme MUST allow it to represent all discriminators shorter than X
bits, using X bits. Routers MUST always return routes using at least as many
bits in the first discriminator as are used for the discriminator for the node
who is asking. Finally, switches MUST drop packets for which the discriminator
is represented in fewer bits than the smallest representation of the source
interface for the packet. Switches SHOULD send back an error packet so that the
bogus route may be purged as soon as possible.

A packet whose label requests that it be routed back down the same interface from
which it came SHOULD be dropped and an error packet SHOULD be sent back so that
the "redundant route" may be resolved.

Since label space is most efficiently used when a switch's largest
discriminator is closest in size to its smallest discriminator, renumbering
interfaces is encouraged, especially right after start up when all interfaces
have just been registered. However, switches SHOULD NOT re-number more than
necessary as it breaks existing routes which run through them.


## The Router

A router has 3 functions, it periodically searches for things, responds to
searches, and forwards packets. When a router responds to a search, it responds
with nodes which it thinks will get closer to the destination. The responses
MUST NOT have addresses which are, in address space distance, further from the
responding node than the search target, and they MUST NOT have routes which
begin with the same interface as the route to the querying node. These two
simple rules provide that no search will ever go in circles and no route will
ever go down an interface, only to be bounced back. While the second rule can
only be enforced by the honor system, querying nodes MUST double check the first
rule. The node doing the searching adds the newly discovered nodes to their
routing table and to the search, then continues the search by asking them.

Upon receiving a search response containing one's own address, a node SHOULD
purge all entries from its table whose routes begin with that route. This will
control the proliferation of redundant routes.

The "address space distance" between any two given addresses is defined as the
of the result of the two addresses XOR'd against one another, rotated 64 bits,
then interpreted as a big endian integer. The so called "XOR metric" was
pioneered in the work on [Kademlia] DHT system and is used to forward a packet
to someone who probably knows the whole route to the destination. The 64 bit
rotation of the result is used to improve performance where the first bits of
the address is fixed to avoid collisions in the IPv6 space.

Adding nodes to the routing table from search responses is done by splicing the
route to the node which was asked with the route to the node in the response,
yielding a route to the final destination through them.

Router messages are sent as normal UDP/IPv6 packets except that their UDP source
and destination port numbers are zero and the hop limit (TTL) field in the IPv6
header is set to zero. Any packet which meets these characteristics is to be
considered a router message and any packet which doesn't is not. It is critical
that inter-router communications are themselves, not routed because it would
break the label splicing for search responses.

The content of the inter-router messages is [bEncoded][bEncode] dictionaries.
Routers send search queries which have a key called "q", and replies which
don't. Routers SHOULD reply to a message with a "q" entry but MUST NOT reply if
there is none, lest they reply to a reply. All messages have a transaction id
number, a sort of cookie made of a bencoded string containing arbitrary bytes
which must be reflected back in the reply. The most common query is a find node
or "fn" query. "fn" queries have a field called "tar" for the target address
which the node is looking for. Responses to "fn" queries have a field called "n"
which is a binary string containing the 32 byte public keys and 8 byte switch
labels for the responses.

Example fn query in JSON:

    {
        "q":    "fn",
        "tar":  "abcdefghhijklmno",
        "txid": "12345"
    }

Same query bEncoded as the routers use:

    d1:q2:fn3:tar16:abcdefghhijklmno4:txid5:12345e

Example fn reply in JSON:
NOTE: this reply only shows 2 nodes returned and is for illustration purposes
in most cases the number would be an implementation specific constant around 8.

    {
        "n": "cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghi1234567qponmlkjihgzyxwvutsrstuvwxyzabcde2345678"
        "txid": "12345"
    }

Same reply bEncoded

    d1:n80:cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghi1234567qponmlkjihgzyxwvutsrstuvwxyzabcde2345678e


The nodes in an fn reply are ordered from worst to best so the best answer is
the last entry in the reply.

Routers choose the node to forward a packet to in a similar way to how they
answer search queries. They select nodes from their routing table except in this
case the selection contains only one node. The packet is sent through the
CryptoAuth session corresponding to this node and the label for getting to it is
applied to the packet before sending to the switch. The "search target" for
forwarding a packet is the IPv6 destination address of the packet.


## The CryptoAuth

The CryptoAuth is a mechanism for wrapping interfaces, you supply it with an
interface and optionally a key, and it gives you a new interface which allows
you to send packets to someone who has that key. Like the rest of cjdns, it is
designed to function with best effort data transit. The CryptoAuth handshake
is based on piggybacking headers on top of regular data packets and while the
traffic in handshake packets is encrypted and authenticated, it is not secure
against replay attacks and has no forward secrecy if the private key is
compromised. The CryptoAuth header adds takes 120 bytes of overhead to the
packet, causing a fluctuating MTU.

There are 5 types of CryptoAuth header:

1. Connect To Me - Used to start a session without knowing the other node's key.
2. Hello Packet  - The first message in beginning a session.
3. Key Packet    - The second message in a session.
4. Data Packet   - A normal traffic packet.
5. Authenticated - A traffic packet with Poly1305 authentication.

All CryptoAuth headers are 120 bytes long except for the Data Packet header
which is 4 bytes and the Authenticated header which is 20 bytes. The first 4
bytes of any CryptoAuth header is a big endian number which is used to determine
its type, this is the so-called "Session State" number. If it is the inverse of
zero, it is a Connect To Me header, if it is zero, it is a Hello Packet, if one
or two, it is a Hello Packet or repeated Hello Packet, if it is three or four,
it is a Key Packet or repeated Key Packet. If it is any number larger than four,
it is either a Data Packet or an Authenticated packet, depending on whether
authentication was requested during the handshake.

### 1) Connect To Me Packet

If "Session State" is equal to the bitwise complement of zero, the sender is
requesting that the recipient begin a connection with him, this is done in cases
when the initiator of the connection does not know the key for the recipient.
If the entire header is not present the recipient MUST drop the packet silently,
the only field which is read in the packet is the "Permanent Public Key" field,
all others SHOULD be ignored, specifically, content MUST not be passed on
because it cannot be authenticated. The recipient of such a packet SHOULD send
back a "hello" packet if there is no established connection. If there is already
a connection over the interface, the recipient SHOULD NOT respond but MAY allow
the connection to time out faster.


### 2) Hello Packet

If the "Session State" field is equal to the one or two, the packet is a Hello
Packet or a repeated Hello Packet. If no connection is present, one MAY be
established and the recipient MAY send a Key Packet in response but it is
RECOMMENDED that he wait until he has data to send first. A node who has sent a
Hello Packet, has gotten no response and now wishes to send more data MUST send
that data as more (repeat) Hello Packets. The temporary public key and the
content are encrypted and authenticated using the permanent public keys of the
two nodes and "Random Nonce" in the header. The content and temporary key is
encrypted and authenticated using crypto_box_curve25519poly1305xsalsa20()
function.


### 3) Key Packet

If the "Session State" field is equal to two or three, the packet is a Key
Packet. Key Packets are responses to Hello Packets and like Hello Packets, they
contain a temporary public key encrypted and authenticated along with the data.
Once a node receives a Key Packet it may begin sending data packets. A node who
has received a Hello Packet, sent a Key Packet, gotten no further response, and
now wishes to send more data MUST send that data as more (repeat) key packets.


### 4) Data Packet

The traditional data packet has only 4 bytes of header, these 4 bytes are the
nonce which is used for the cipher, the packet is enciphered using
crypto_stream_salsa20_xor() with the nonce, converted to little endian encoding,
and copied to the first four bytes of the 8 byte nonce required by 
crypto_stream_salsa20_xor() unless the node is the initiator of the connection
(the sender of the hello packet), in which case it is copied over the second
four bytes of the space, thus allowing for a single session to handle 2^32
packets in either direction.


### 5) Authenticated Packet

The Authenticated Packet is sent if Poly1305 authentication was requested by
either node during the handshake. Like the Data Packet, the first 4 bytes is
used as the nonce, in this case it is a 24 byte nonce and
crypto_box_curve25519poly1305xsalsa20() is used to encrypt and decrypt the data,
but the methodology is exactly the same. If a packet is not authenticated, it
MUST be silently dropped.


#### ReplayProtector

When packet authentication is enabled, the packet is checked for replay attacks
(intentional or accidental) the replay protection method is to use a 32 bit
offset and a 32 bit bitfield to create a sliding window. When a packet comes in,
its nonce is compared to the offset, if it is less then the offset, it is
discarded. If when subtracted from the offset, the result is less than or equal
to 32, 1 is shifted left by the result, bitwise ANDed against the bitfield and
compared to zero, if it is not zero then the packet is a duplicate and is
discarded. If it is zero then it is OR'd against the bitfield to set the same
bit is set and the packet is passed along. If the result of subtraction is
greater than 32, 32 is subtracted from it, this result is added to the offset,
the bitfield is shifted left by this amount, then the least significant bit in
the bitfield is set. This is obviously only available when packets are
authenticated but provides a secure protection against replay attacks and
accidentally duplicated packets EG: from 802.11 noise.

This solution is limited in that packets which are more then 32 "slots" out of
order will be discarded. In some cases, this could be a benefit since in best
effort networking, never is often better than late.


### Authentication field:

This field allows a node to connect using a password or other shared secret,
the AuthType field specifies how the secret should be used to connect.

The "A" flag is used to indicate that the node is requesting the session use
Poly1305 authentication for all of its packets. The "AuthType Specific" fields
specific to the authentication type.


#### AuthType Zero

AuthType Zero is no authentication at all. If the AuthType is set to zero, all
AuthType Specific fields are disregarded and SHOULD be set to random numbers.


#### AuthType One

AuthType One is a SHA-256 based authentication method.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

With AuthType One, the shared secret (password) is hashed once and the result is
appended to the 32 byte output from scalar multiplication of the curve25519 keys
these 64 bytes are hashed again with SHA-256 to make the symmetric key to be
used for the session. It is also hashed a second time and the result copied over
the first 8 bytes of the authentication header before the AuthType field is set.
The effect being that the "Hash Code" field contains bytes 2 through 8 the hash
of the hash of the password. This is used as a sort of username so that the
other end knows which password to try using in the handshake.

If Derivations is non-zero, an additional step is included, the two most
significant bytes of the password hash are XORed against the two bytes of the
network representation of Derivations and it is hashed using SHA-256 once
again before being included in the generation of the symmetric key. This form is
notably NOT used in the Hash Code field.

This allows a node Alice, to give a secret to Charlie, which he can use to start
a CryptoAuth session with Bob, without leaking Alice's shared secret. This
allows nodes to generate, share and derive secrets through trusted connections,
creating new trusted connections and use them to share more secrets, adding a
measure of forward secrecy in the event of a cryptographic weakness found in
the asymmetric cryptography.


## Pulling It All Together

The journey of a packet begins at the user interface device (TUN or similar).
The user sends an IPv6 packet which comes in to the TUN device and enters the
engine, it is checked to make sure its source and destination addresses are
valid and then a router lookup is made on the destination address. cjdns
addresses are the first 16 bytes of the SHA-512 of the SHA-512 of the public
key. All addresses must begin with the byte `0xFC` otherwise they are invalid,
generating a key is done by brute force key generation until the result of the
double SHA-512 begins with `0xFC`.

After the router lookup, the node compares the destination address to the
address of the next router, if they are the same, the inner layer of
encryption is skipped. Assuming they are different, the IPv6 header is copied
to a safe place and a CryptoAuth session is selected for the destination
address, or created if there is none, and the packet content is passed through
it. The IPv6 header is re-applied on top of the CryptoAuth header for the
content, the packet length field in the IPv6 header is notably *not* altered to
reflect the headers which are now under it.

The packet is now ready to send to the selected router. For sending the packet
to the router, a CryptoAuth session is selected for the router's address and
the packet, from IPv6 header down, is passed through it. A switch header is
applied to the resulting encrypted structure and it is sent down to the switch
for routing.

The switch takes the packet and sends it to a network module which uses yet
another CryptoAuth session to encipher and authenticate the packet from the
switch header down. The resulting data is packaged in a network packet and sent
to the switch at the next node.

Upon receiving the packet, the next node sends the packet through its
CryptoAuth session thus revealing the switch header and it sends the packet to
its switch. The switch most likely will send the packet out to another endpoint
as per the dictate of the packet label but may send it to its router, eventually
the node for which the packet is destine will receive it.

The router, upon receiving the packet will examine it to see if it appears to be
a CryptoAuth Connect To Me packet, Hello packet, or Key packet. If it is one of
these, it will insert the IPv6 address, as derived from the public key in the
header, into a hashtable so it can be looked up by the switch label. Otherwise
it will do a lookup. If the Address cannot be found in its hashtable, it will
try asking the router if it knows of a node by that label and if all fails, the
packet will be dropped.

From the IPv6 address, it will lookup the CryptoAuth session or create one if
necessary, then pass the opaque data through the CryptoAuth session to get the
decrypted IPv6 header.

If the source address for the packet is the same as the double SHA-512 of the
public key for the router from which it came, it's assumed to have no inner
layer of encryption and it is written to the TUN device as it is. If its source
address is different, it is passed back through a CryptoAuth session as selected
based on the source IPv6 address. The IPv6 header is then moved up to meet the
content (into the place where the CryptoAuth header had been) and the final
packet is written out to the TUN device.

It is a set of extensions to DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality."

[DNS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "A hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most importantly, it translates domain names meaningful to humans into the numerical identifiers associated with networking equipment for the purpose of locating and addressing these devices worldwide."

[P2P]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads among peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes."

[Internet]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "A global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies."

[DDoS]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "An attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Although the means to carry out, motives for, and targets of a DoS attack may vary, it generally consists of the concerted efforts of a person, or multiple people to prevent an Internet site or service from functioning efficiently or at all, temporarily or indefinitely."

[DHT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table "A class of a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table; (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. Responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption. This allows a DHT to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node arrivals, departures, and failures."
