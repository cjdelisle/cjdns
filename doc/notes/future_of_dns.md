Hello guys.
A Decentralized but abandoned DNS project is djdns. Can we relaunch the Project? Maybe under the [Hyperboria Github Org](https://github.com/hyperboria).

https://github.com/campadrenalin/python-djdns

https://github.com/ocmeshnet/djdns-hype-flat

it's decentralized, and extremly secure. Can we relaunch the project?

Thx, Kyler aka GlitchedPixels @kylerschin
