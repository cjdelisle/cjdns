# Starting your own Mesh Local

One of the first things to come to terms with is that a mesh network is **peer to peer** and **non-heirarchical**. A mesh local should reflect this, and not depend entirely upon one individual to coordinate its actions.

When you find someone else who is interested, divide "duties" according to your respective skill sets, and don't worry about getting everything right to begin with. Responsibility has a way of motivating people.

You'll want to create at least a minimal web presence so that those interested in getting involved can do so. This often includes, but need not be limited to:

* A website
* At least one designated individual who can speak for the project
* An irc channel where new users can be directed
* A link to a mailing list, if you have one (also very handy). If you'd like a solid mailing list instead of hosting your own, contact [finn](mailto:finn@seattlemesh.net).
* A short description of your local's particular goals
