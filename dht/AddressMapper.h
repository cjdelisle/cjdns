/** Address mapper doubly linked list LRU cache.
 * The most recently used item is on the head.
 * The least recently used item is on the tail.
 *
 * When an item is used, it is relocated to the head. Searching from the
 * head therefore means items will be checked in most-recently-used order.
 *
 * When inserting a new item, the item to replace - the least-recently-used item - is simply the tail.
 * Then the tail is set to be the head, because it is the most recently used item.
