Ubuntu Packaging for cjdns
----------------------------

This packaging is designed for use in daily builds and targets Ubuntu 14.04 and higher.

It provides three binary packages:
 * "cjdns" contains:
   - cjdns itself
   - Upstart script for autostart on boot and easy control through commands like "sudo restart cjdns"
   - skeleton configuration file in /etc/cjdns.conf
   - advanced tools for messing with cjdns internals in /usr/lib/cjdns
   - Python modules for interfacing with cjdns admin port for use in your own Python scripts
 * "cjdns-dynamic" contains:
   - Separate wrapper that allows peering by a dynamic domain name instead of IP address, already chained to cjdns
   - config file for the said wrapper at /etc/cjdns-dynamic.conf
 * "cjdns-dbg":
   - Debugging symbols for cjdns, useful for reporting and investigating crashes.

The package provides both Upstart and systemd configs and should, in theory,
work on Debian Jessie. It was not tested.
