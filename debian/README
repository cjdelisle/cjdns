The Ubuntu Package cjdns
----------------------------

This packaging is designed for use in daily builds and targets Ubuntu 12.04.
I do not fill in the changelog because of that. 
See the commit log on the repository if you need a changelog.

This package includes Ubuntu-specific items like Upstart script.

It does not yet include perl/python/etc libraries for cdjns administration 
because I have no idea where to install them and how to do it properly.
