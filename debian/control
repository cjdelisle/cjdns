Description: Encrypted networking for regular people
 Cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public key cryptography
 for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing.
 This provides near zero-configuration networking without many of the security
 and robustness issues that regular IPv4 and IPv6 networks have.
