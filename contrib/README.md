# Contrib

This is a place for code which is not officially part of cjdns but is useful as
a complement. cjdns is 100% C99 licensed under the GPLv3 and has only 2
dependencies, for front-end code, this is too restrictive so there exists
contrib where code can be added without concern about using other dependencies,
licenses and languages.


## Licensing

Non-GPLv3 free software licenses are okay, any file which is licensed under a
different license should have an additional file created in the same directory
with the name of the file followed by .LICENSE.txt with it's license so that it
is clear, for example: jssha256.js.LICENSE.txt in the same directory as
jssha256.js
