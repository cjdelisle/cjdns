# Fedora Packaging

This is a place for packaging designed for the Fedora family of linux distros,
including EPEL. Fedora uses RPM packages, which are built from pristine source
after applying a set of patches. The pristine source for cjdns is pulled from
the github tagged versions for cjdelisle/cjdns. Patches that are generally
applicable will also be submitted as a pull request on github. Other patches,
such as changing genconf to use a unique chroot dir and unprivileged user, will
remain as patch files.
