# Simple example IPv6 Firewall configuration.
# Derived from http://www.exp-networks.be/blog/ipv6-firewall/
#
# permits only outbound, connected and core ICMP messages on tun0
# - does not filter other interfaces at all.
# - Adds one rule to the INPUT chain
# - Adds a new chain for tun0
# - edit and change the INPUT_PORTS rules to run services.
# - there is no stop facility - if you can't figure out how to reset an
#   ip6tables firewall, you shouldn't do so!
