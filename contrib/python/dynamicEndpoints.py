"""
dynamicEndpoints.py: make cjdns reliably connect to remote nodes with dynamic IP
addresses, identified by a DNS name.

Requires a config file with a section for each dynamic-IP node, like this:

    [lhjs0njqtvh1z4p2922bbyp2mksmyzf5lb63kvs3ppy78y1dj130.k]
    hostname: verge.info.tm
    port: 6324
    password: ns6vn00hw0buhrtc4wbk8sv230

The section name (in square brackets) is the public key of the node. Then the
hostname, port, and peering password for the node are given.

By default, this program looks up the current Internet IP of each node defined
in the config file, and add that node at that IP to the local cjdns instance.
Unless the --noWait option is given, or the $nowait environment variable is
true, the program then continues running, waiting for cjdns to log messages
about those peers being unresponsive and updating the peers' Internet IP
addresses as needed.

If cjdns dies while the program is monitoring for messages, the program will
hang indefinitely.

Requires that the $HOME/.cjdnsadmin file be correctly set up. See
cjdnsadminmaker.py if that is not the case.
