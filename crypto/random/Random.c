/**
 * cjdns random generator:
 * It is with great apprehension that I have decided to go forward with this random generator.
 * Sadly there doesn't exist any plain-and-simple random generation library for C without
 * bundling libevent, openssl or some other megalyth.
 *
 * Additionally most random generators use a feedback loop which is difficult to validate as
 * it has a period which is not immedietly obvious by looking at it. Additionally, this
 * feedback loop design leads to issues like:
 * http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_prng.txt
 *
 * How this random generator works:
 * 1. All available random sources such as dev/urandom and sysctl(RANDOM_UUID) are combined
 *    with a rolling SHA-512 hash, the result is placed in the Random_SeedGen union.
 *
 * 2. Random_SeedGen is SHA-256 hashed into Random.tempSeed
 *
 * 3. Random numbers are generated by running salsa20 with Random.tempSeed as the key, and
 *    Random.nonce 64 bit counter which is incremented each run, never reset, and assumed
 *    never to wrap.
 *
 * Adding entropy to the generator is as follows:
 * Random_addRandom() adds a sample of randomness by rotating and XORing it into
 * Random_SeedGen.collectedEntropy.
 * Every 256 calls to Random_addRandom(), Random_SeedGen is again hashed into Random.tempSeed.
 * Note that Random.nonce is *not* reset ever during the operation of the generator because
 * otherwise, 512 successive calls to Random_addRandom() with the same input would cause the
 * random generator to repeat.
 *
 *
 * State-compromize extension:
 * It is acknoliged that a compromize of the generator's internal state will result in the
 * attacker knowing every output which has been and will be generated or with the current
 * tempSeed. After a further 256 calls to Random_addRandom(), the generator should recover.
 *
 * While using a feedback loop with a one-way hash function to frustrate backtracking seems
 * enticing, it stands to reason that the only way a hash function can be one-way is by
 * destroying entropy, destruction of entropy in a feedback system could lead to an oscillation
 * effect when it becomes entropy starved. Though this issue does not seem to have been
 * exploited in other prngs, proving that it cannot be exploited is beyond my abilities and the
 * devil you know is better than the devil you don't.
 *
 *
 * Iterative Guessing:
 * This generator only introduces the entropy given by Random_addRandom() once every 256 calls.
 * Assuming each call introduces at least 1 bit of good entropy, iterative guessing requires
 * guessing a 256 bit value for each iteration.
 *
 *
 * Input based Attacks:
 * The generator is as conservitive as possible about the entropy provided in calls to
 * Random_addRandom(), valuing each at 1 bit of entropy. Since the number is rotated and XORd
 * into collectedEntropy, some calls with 0 bits of entropy can be smoothed over by other calls
 * with > 1 bit of entropy. If Random_addRandom() is called arbitrarily many times with 0 bits
 * of entropy, since the inputs are XORd into collectedEntropy the entropy level of
 * collectedEntropy will remain unchanged.
 *
 * Even if the attacker is able to gather information from the generator's output and craft
 * inputs to Random_addRandom() which *decrease* the entropy in collectedEntropy, this will not
 * decrease the performance of the generator itself because the 256 bit Random_SeedGen.seed
 * is seeded with the primary seed meterial (eg dev/urandom) and never altered for duration of
 * the generator's operation.
