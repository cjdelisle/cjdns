/**
 * Allocator for structured memory management.
 * The objective of the allocator structure is to make manual memory management easier, specifically
 * to make making a mistake difficult.
 *
 * Every function which allocates memory, either to return a structure or to do processing which
 * cannot be done on the stack takes an allocator as a parameter.
 *
 * In traditional C, each call to malloc() must be traced to a corresponding free() call, a
 * laborious process which can be partially automated but inevitably leaves some memory leak
 * investigative work to the developer. Allocator attempts to move the memory freeing operations
 * close to the memory allocations thus making bugs easy to spot without searching over large
 * amounts of code.
 *
 * With Allocator, you might do the following:
 *
 * struct Allocator* child = Allocator_child(myAlloc); <-- myAlloc is the one provided to you
 * potentiallyLeakyFunction(child);
 * Allocator_free(child);
 *
 * Given this simple pattern, as long as potentiallyLeakyFunction() did not bypass the allocator
 * system using malloc() directly, we can prove that it is not the source of a memory leak.
 * As the real code is far more complex than this contrived example, there are a few rules which
 * have proven useful in preventing both memory leaks and dangling pointers.
 *
 * #1 Do not create new root allocators, create child allocators instead.
 * When you call MallocAllocator_new() or equivalent, you are creating a parentless allocator and
 * you must take responsibility for it's freeing when you are finished with it. In cjdns there is
 * only one call to a main allocator and all other allocators are spawned from it using
 * Allocator_child().
 * Exception: In certain code which interfaces with libuv, an alternate root allocator is necessary
 *    because libuv teardown process is asynchronous and memory used by libuv must not be freed
 *    until this is complete.
 *
 * #2 Free your allocators and not anyone else's.
 * With precious few exceptions, an allocator is always freed in the same .c file where it was
 * created. It is obviously rude to destroy something of someone else's just as it is rude to leave
 * things lying around expecting someone else to clean up after you. Sometimes you want to "take
 * ownership" of some memory which somebody else allocated and they are passing to you. Rather
 * than slowly allocate your own memory and copy the data over, you can use Allocator_adopt() to
 * hold that memory in existance until you and the creator both are finished with it.
 *
 * #3 Assume that any allocator may be freed at any time.
 * A typical example is the ping message. When a ping is sent, a structure is allocated to hold
 * information about the ping so that when the response comes back it will be recognized. That
 * structure is inserted into a table of outstanding pings. If that allocator were freed while the
 * ping was outstanding, the response would come back and the table lookup would access freed
 * memory. To prevent this, every place where temporary memory is placed into a more permanent
 * structure (the table), Allocator_onFree() is used to hook the freeing of that memory and add a
 * function to remove the entry from the table.
 * Cjdns is notably lacking in "deregister" or "cancel" type functions as the accepted method of
 * deregistering a peer or cancelling an operation is by freeing the associated allocator, both
 * simplifying the code and avoiding bug prone "cold" codepaths.
 *
 * The function pointers in the allocator structure are best called through the associated macros.
