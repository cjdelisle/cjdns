#### *Networking Reinvented*

BonsaiMesh implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public-key cryptography for
address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing. This provides
near-zero-configuration networking, and prevents many of the security and
scalability issues that plague existing networks.

## How to install BonsaiMesh

These instructions are for Debian-based Linux distributions and macOS. They should be
informative enough for use on other distributions - just don't expect them to
work verbatim. If you want to know what [operating system's base is go here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg).

### 0. Install dependencies

On both platforms, installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), although preferable,
is not strictly necessary. If Node.js is unavailable or an unacceptable version,
it will be downloaded and installed in the source tree.

#### Debian-based distro:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs git build-essential python2.7

#### Fedora 22+ based distro:

    sudo dnf install nodejs git
    sudo dnf install @development-tools

#### RHEL based distro (adds the EPEL repo):

    sudo yum localinstall https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    sudo yum install nodejs git
    sudo yum install @development-tools

#### Building from package:

    sudo yum localinstall https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/cjdns/17.4/4.el6/src/cjdns-17.4-4.el6.src.rpm

If you are on a laptop and suspend or hibernate it, cjdroute will take a few
minutes to make coffee and figure out what just happened when it wakes up.  You
can speed this up dramatically with:

    systemctl enable cjdns-resume

The resume service restarts cjdns when the system wakes up from sleep.

#### Gentoo

    emerge --ask nodejs sys-devel/gcc dev-lang/python:3.4 dev-vcs/git

#### macOS:

Install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    brew install cjdns

Install with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):

    sudo port install cjdns

#### OpenBSD:

    pkg_add git node gcc gmake bash

Select version gcc-4.8.1p2 or more recent.

#### FreeBSD:

Everything you need is available prebuild in FreeBSD' ports.

    pkg install gmake node

#### Arch:

#### Gentoo:

##### Layman:

First, you need to install layman.

    emerge layman

If layman is installed correctly, you can add the overlay

    layman -f
    layman -a weuxel

For future update of the overlay use

    layman -S

Now you can install cjdns

    emerge cjdns

##### By hand:

You will have to clone the overlay repository

    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/Weuxel/portage-weuxel.git

Now tell portage to use this repo

    cd /etc/portage/repos.conf/

Create a file `portage-weuxel.conf` containing

    [weuxel]
    location = /opt/portage-weuxel
    masters = gentoo
    auto-sync = yes

Now sync

    emerge --sync

And install cjdns

    emerge cjdns

#### Automatic crash detection and restart

Copy the the openrc init script from `contrib/openrc` to `/etc/init.d/` and modify the `CONFFILE` and `command` parameter to your needs.
Then start cjdns by issuing

    /etc/init.d/cjdns start

Configure the init system to autostart cjdns

    rc-update add cjdns default

Copy the service_restart script `contrib/gentoo/service_restart.sh` to any convenient directory on
your system and modify the eMail address. If you do not wish to be notified, comment out the whole line.
Now add a crontab entry like this

    # Restart crashed Services
    * * * * *       root	/path/to/script/service_restart.sh

#### Solus:

Dependencies:

    sudo eopkg install nodejs git build-essential system.devel python gcc binutils kernal-headers xorg-server-devel

Then Follow the steps below:

*Sorry for so many steps. A package is being worked on currently*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setup

This part assumes you want to build BonsaiMesh by hand

##### 1. Retrieve BonsaiMesh from GitHub

Clone the repository from GitHub and change to the source directory:

    git clone https://github.com/bonsaimesh/bonsaimesh.git bonsaimesh
    cd bonsaimesh

##### 2. Build

    ./do

Look for `Build completed successfully, type ./cjdroute to begin setup.`, then
proceed below:

Run cjdroute without options for HELP:

    ./cjdroute

#### 0. Make sure you've got the stuff.

If you're on macOS, don't worry about this step.

    LANG=C cat /dev/net/tun

If it says: `cat: /dev/net/tun: File descriptor in bad state` Good!

If it says: `cat: /dev/net/tun: No such file or directory`, create it using:

    sudo mkdir -p /dev/net &&
    sudo mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200 &&
    sudo chmod 0666 /dev/net/tun

Then `cat /dev/net/tun` again.

If it says: `cat: /dev/net/tun: Permission denied` You're probably using a VPS
based on the OpenVZ virtualization platform. Ask your provider to enable the
TUN/TAP device - this is standard protocol so they should know exactly what you
need.


#### 1. Generate a new configuration file

    ./bonsaimesh --genconf >> bonsai.conf

**Protect your conf file!**

A lost conf file means you lost your password and
connections and anyone who connected to you will no longer be able to connect.
A compromised conf file means that other people can impersonate you on the
network.

To generate a conf file with permissions set so that only your user can
read it and write to it:

    (umask 077 && ./bonsai --genconf > bonsai.conf)


#### 2. Find a friend

To get into an existing network (e.g. Hyperboria), you need to connect to
someone who is already in the network. This is required for a number of
reasons:

1. It helps prevent abuse because bad people will be less likely to abuse a
   system after they were, in an act of human kindness, given access to that
   system.
2. This is not intended to overlay The Old Internet, it is intended to replace
   it. Each connection will in due time be replaced by a wire, a fiber optic
   cable, or a wireless network connection.
3. In any case of a disagreement, there will be a "chain of friends" linking
   the people involved so there will already be a basis for coming to a
   resolution.

To find a friend, get out there and join our [community](#community). Also, have
a look at the [Hyperboria Map][] to find peers near you.


#### 3. Connect your node to your friend's node

**To initiate the connection OUTbound**

In your conf file, you will see:

``` javascript
// Nodes to connect to.
"connectTo":
{
    // Add connection credentials here to join the network
    // Ask somebody who is already connected.
}
```

A conf file with multiple friend-nodes, setup OUTbound, should look like:

``` javascript
// Nodes to connect to.
"connectTo":
{
    //friend_1 (IPv4: 0.1.2.3; IPv6 fcaa:5bac:66e4:713:cb00:e446:c317:fc39)
    "0.1.2.3:45678":
    {
        "login": "k.alexander"
        "password": "thisIsNotARealConnection_1",
        "publicKey": "thisIsJustForAnExampleDoNotUseThisInYourConfFile_1.k"
    },

    //friend_2 (IPv4: 5.1.2.3; IPv6 fcbb:5bac:66e4:713:cb00:e446:c317:fc39)
    "5.1.2.3:5678":
    {
        "login": "k.alexander"
        "password": "thisIsNotARealConnection_2",
        "publicKey": "thisIsJustForAnExampleDoNotUseThisInYourConfFile_2.k"
    }
}
```

You can add as many connections as you want to the `connectTo` attribute,
following JSON syntax.


**To allow your friend to initiate the connection INbound**

In your conf file, you will see:

``` javascript
"authorizedPasswords":
[
    // A unique string which is known to the client and server.
    {"password": "password001", "login": "default-login"}

    // More passwords should look like this.
    // {"password": "password002", "login": "my-second-peer"}
    // {"password": "password003", "login": "my-third-peer}
    // {"password": "password004", "login": "my-fourth-peer"}
    ...

    // "your.external.ip.goes.here:45678":{"login": "default-login", "password": "password001","publicKey":thisisauniqueKEY_001.k"}

],
```

A conf file with multiple friend-nodes, setup INbound, should look like:
``` javascript
"authorizedPasswords":
[
    // A unique string which is known to the client and server.
    {"password": "thisisauniquestring_001", "user": "k.alexander"}

    // More passwords should look like this.
    //William Jevons (IPv4: 0.1.2.3; IPv6 fcaa:5bac:66e4:713:cb00:e446:c317:fc39)
    {"password": "thisisauniquestring_002", "user": "William Jevons"}
    //Marilyn Patel (IPv4: 5.1.2.3; IPv6 fcbb:5bac:66e4:713:cb00:e446:c317:fc39)
    {"password": "thisisauniquestring_003", "user": "Marilyn Patel"}
    // {"password": "thisisauniquestring_004"}
    ...

    // "your.external.ip.goes.here:45678":{"password": "thisisauniquestring_001","publicKey":thisisauniqueKEY_001.k"}
],
```


You need to give William Jevons (who is making the INbound connection) the following 4 items:

1. Your external IPv4
2. The port found in your conf file here:

    `// Bind to this port.
    "bind": "0.0.0.0:yourportnumberishere",`

3. Their unique password that you uncommented or created: `"password": "thisisauniquestring_002"`
4. Your public key: `"publicKey": "thisisauniqueKEY_001.k"`
5. His username: "William Jevons"

His login credentials will look something like this (with your IPv4 and port):

```javascript
"1.2.3.4:56789": {
    "login": "William Jevons",
    "password": "thisisauniquestring_002",
    "publicKey": "thisIsJustForAnExampleDoNotUseThisInYourConfFile_1.k"
}
```

Please note that you and your friend can *initiate* a
connection either outbound (from YOU --> FRIEND) or inbound (from FRIEND --> YOU)
but traffic flows both ways once the connection is established.

See [doc/configure.md](doc/configure.md) for more details on configuration,
including how to peer with other cjdns nodes over ethernet and wifi.


#### 4. Secure your system - check for listening services

Once your node is running, you're now a newly minted IPv6 host. Your operating
system may automatically reconfigure network services to use this new address.
If this is not what you intend, you should check to see that you are not
offering more services than you intended to. ;)

See [doc/network-services.md](doc/network-services.md) for instructions.


#### 5. Start it up!

    sudo ./cjdroute < cjdroute.conf

If you want to have your logs written to a file:

    sudo ./cjdroute < cjdroute.conf > cjdroute.log

To stop cjdns:

    sudo killall cjdroute

If you are having problems use `killall cjdroute` to return to sanity. Use
`pgrep cjdroute` or `top` to see if it running.

**NOTE!**

This starts cjdns as the root user so it can configure your system
without concern for permissions. To start cjdns as a non-root user, see
[doc/non-root-user.md](doc/non-root-user.md).


#### 6. Get in IRC

Welcome to the network! You're now a network administrator. There are
responsibilities which come with being a network administrator which include
being available in case there is something wrong with your equipment. You should
stay on [IRC](#community) so that people can reach you.


### Admin interface

When cjdroute is up and running, the admin interface will be available at
`udp://localhost:11234` (this can be changed in the `cjdroute.conf`
configuration file). See [doc/admin-api.md](doc/admin-api.md) for more
information about the admin interface. There are several tools in `contrib/`
that can interact with it.

You can access the admin API with:

* the **Python library**; see [here](contrib/python/README.md).
* the **Perl library**, maintained by Mikey; see [here](contrib/perl/CJDNS/README).


## Reporting issues
1. Don't report in this repo, please instead report it at https://github.com/hyperboria/bugs/issues
2. Get on IRC and talk to somebody
3. What will happen is either
 * Someone feels like fixing it
 * You feel like fixing it
 * Nobody cares about it and it will be forgotten for a while and maybe someone will hit it later
 and fix it or else it will get wiped away in a refactoring
 * Nobody can fix it at the moment but it is considered worth remembering because it has great
 significance to the way the code is developed, in this case it needs to be explained in technical
 terms by someone with strong familiarity with the code. They will make a pull request to the
 docs/bugs directory.

## Security
Security issues should be reported on IRC the same as other bugs. We don't have a closed
group of people with special knowledge so that means the default security reporting method is
full disclosure.

See: [security_specification.md](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/security_specification.md) to see if a
possible security issue is really a security issue.

That time of year again... Time for some open source Projects!
