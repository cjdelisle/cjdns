# Docs

*Documenting things related to the meshnet*

[cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) addresses a large number of complex issues in an elegant way. While efforts have been made to provide a default configuration that matches the greatest number of use cases, it is impractical to expect software to replace understanding.

> Enter the documentation project...

The good citizens of Hyperboria decided to put together this collection of documentation to help make the inner workings of cjdns more transparent.

We want you to [get involved](http://roaming-initiative.com/blog/posts/wtfm)! Feel free to submit pull requests.

See [index.md](index.md) for current progress. We'd love more languages!

## The scope of this project

We are interested in documenting a range of topics:

1. cjdns internals: bugs and features
2. operator culture and best practices
3. meshlocal resources
4. introductory literature

## Reporting bugs

[cjd](https://github.com/cjdelisle) would rather write code than troubleshoot trivial issues which often turn out to have resulted from user error. To make this easier, a few members of the community have offered to investigate issues on his behalf.

If you think you've found a bug, report it on [our fork's issue tracker](https://github.com/hyperboria/cjdns/issues). We'll try to gather up documentation related to the issue, to better understand where it might be coming from. Once we can narrow it down, and research some of the background details to that particular piece of functionality, we may be able to submit patches ourselves.

Anything you can submit that gets us closer to understanding some bug or function within cjdns is welcome. By starting an inquiry, you make it just a little bit easier for someone else to continue it. Get involved!
